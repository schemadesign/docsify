#### 3. Give a reference name to your Insight
This step is mandatory, and you will not be able to "Create" your insight if you skip that step. The current nomenclature is **[Insight] Title**. A well defined naming convention will increase readability and understanding of the elements.

For your insight to be filtered and displayed correctly. Relevent tags are **Available Languages**, **Commodity**, **Country**, **Content Insight Type**, and **Themes** .

#### 5. Select a Template
Now that you have named and tagged your insight, you have to **assign it a template**.
The template youâ€™ll use will usually be Insight Article, Insight Discovery, Insight Explainer, etc..
In this example, we will build an Insight Discovery.

#### 6. Build your Content
Once a template has been selected, building blocks will automatically populate the page. 
These blocks **can be removed and shuffled around**, by respectively clicking on the trash or by clicking and holding the vertical dots. 
However, please note that you should always leave the [editorial] Hero block as the first block.
You can also add a new block using the + button on the top right.

*Please see the **[Blocks section](/docs/templates/blocks/index)** for information on the blocks.


#### 7. Create your insight
You will be able to **Create** your insight as soon as a it has a name and a template. Making your insight **Public** will allow it to be available for the public. Please note, however, that a **Public Draft**, which is an element that has been CREATED but NOT PUBLISHED, will not appear on the portal. Please refer to the **[Visibility section](/docs/visibility/index)** for more information about the different visibility levels of a created element.

#### 8. Publishing 
When your insight is ready to be seen on the portal, click on the **Publish** button. Your insight should be on the insight portal shortly after. Also, please note that all changes made to your insight will be lost if not saved. 

Also, any outstanding change to an existing insight will only be visible once the insight is published again.

#### 3. Give a reference name to your Collection Page
This step is mandatory, and you will not be able to "Create" your page if you skip that step. The current nomenclature is **[Collection] Title**. A well defined naming convention will increase readability and understanding of the elements.

#### 4. Select a Template
Now that you have named your page, you have to **assign it a template**.
The template youâ€™ll use will usually be Collection.

#### 5. Build your Content
Once a template has been selected, building blocks will automatically populate the page. 
While these blocks **can be removed and shuffled around**, by respectively clicking on the trash or by clicking and holding the vertical dots, the suggestion is that they stay in this order so each collection page is uniform and consistant.  
If you do choose to switch the blocks around, always leave the [editorial] Collection block as the first block. This block should reflect **the name of the Collections Page**.

#### 6. Add a description
Once you've named your page, you should start adding in details to the page. You can start with the page's desciption which will be in markdown.

#### 8. Connect the insights cards
This block allows you to connect the relevent insight pages to the collections page. The page will automattically populate one insight for each of the three sections: **Explainers, Insights, Discoveries**.
You will need to click the arrow on the right hand side to add additional insights. To choose insights, simply select them from the drop down. Once you've selected the insights you'd like, you can move on to the next section.

#### 9. Publishing 
When your page is ready to be seen on the portal, click on the **Publish** button. Your page should be on the publication portal shortly after. Also, please note that all changes made to your page will be lost if not saved. 

Also, any outstanding change to an existing insight will only be visible once the insight is published again.

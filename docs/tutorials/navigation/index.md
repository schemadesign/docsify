#### 3. Give a reference name to your Navigation item
This step is mandatory, and you will not be able to "Create" your navigation item if you skip that step. **You should name this item as you'd like it to appear on the navigation.**.

#### 4. Select a Template
You will need to assign one of these two choices for the navigation:
- **Small Navigation:** This is for items that will appear on the bottom left side of the drop down navigation. For example, here "Home" will take you to trase.earth and will not have a card image.
- **Navigation Item:** This is for items that will have an image card and appear larger on the navigation.

*Please see the **[Guideline section](/docs/guidelines/index)** for image dimensions and title word count.*


#### 5. Build your Navigation Item
Once you've selected your template, you can begin adding in the information that will appear on the site. This will include:
- URL
- image for the card
- Title that will appear on the navigation

#### 6. Create your Navigation Item
You will be able to **Create** your navigation as soon as a it has a name and a template. Making this **Public** will allow it to be available for the public. Please note, however, that a **Public Draft**, which is an element that has been CREATED but NOT PUBLISHED, will not appear on the portal. Please refer to the **[Visibility section](/docs/visibility/index)** for more information about the different visibility levels of a created element.

#### 7. Publishing 
When your navigation item is ready to be seen on the portal, click on the **Publish** button. Your publication should be on the insights portal shortly after. Also, please note that all changes made to your navigation item will be lost if not saved. 

Also, any outstanding change to an existing navigation will only be visible once the navigation is published again.

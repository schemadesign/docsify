#### 3. Give a reference name to your Publication
This step is mandatory, and you will not be able to "Create" your publication if you skip that step. The current nomenclature is **[Publication Type] Title**. A well define naming convention will increase readability and understanding of the elements.

#### 5. Create your Publication
You will be able to **Create** your publication as soon as a it has a name and a template. Making your publication **Public** will allow it to be available for the public. Please note, however, that a **Public Draft**, which is an element that has been CREATED but NOT PUBLISHED, will not appear on the portal. Please refer to the **[Visibility section](/docs/visibility/index)** for more information about the different visibility levels of a created element.

#### 6. Publishing 
When your publication is ready to be seen on the portal, click on the **Publish** button. Your publication should be on the publication portal shortly after. Also, please note that all changes made to your publication will be lost if not saved. 

Also, any outstanding change to an existing publication will only be visible once the publication is published again.

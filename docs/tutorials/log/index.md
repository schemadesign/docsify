# How to access your SchemaCMS project

### Logging in
To access your project, all Editors need to be invited. If you are an editor, you will (or already have) received an invitation through email.
Once SchemaCMS is deployed on your server, you’ll be able to log into Schema CMS following your custom schemaCMS url.  
Until this, you can access your projects at
https://schemacms.com/

Each project dashboard shows data sources, pages and users.

You can do so by clicking on the Pages tile of by clicking on the Content tab in the navigation header.

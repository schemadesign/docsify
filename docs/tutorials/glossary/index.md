#### 3. Give a reference name to your Collection Page
This step is mandatory, and you will not be able to "Create" your page if you skip that step. The current nomenclature is **[Collection] Title**. A well defined naming convention will increase readability and understanding of the elements.

#### 4. Add a new glossary item
To render properly as a footnote, the added definition needs to have the following structure:
- #Term
- ##Anchor-tag
- ###Definition
- Long Definition

#### 5. Add a glossary term as a footnote
After you have created and saved your new glossary term, you can see it show up on a page by referencing the **anchor-tag** in the CMS.

# Page Templates

When creating a new insight, you should always use the templates. This will ensure you start with the neccasary blocks, though you can choose to delete, add new blocks, or re-arrange some of them.

**Insight Article**

This template is called Insight Article on the front-end and shows up as Insight on the Insights Portal.

**Insight Discovery**

The difference between this template and the Insight Article template is that it does not include a hero image. The smaller space for the title ensures users get to the visualization or content faster.

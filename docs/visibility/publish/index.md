# Publishing your insight

Once you have created your insight, you’ll have to make it public to be able to access the preview.
You can do so by using the « Make it Public » toggle.

Any unsaved change will be lost. Saving allows to update the preview, but does not affect a Published page.

By Publishing a page, you are propagating any saved changes to the live site.

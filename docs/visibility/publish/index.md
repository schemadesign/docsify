Once you have created your insight, you’ll have to make it public to be able to access the preview.
You can do so by using the « Make it Public » toggle.

Any unsaved change will be lost. Saving allows to update the preview, but does not affect a Published page.

If you wish to make the insights available for RSS feeds, just toggle on the RSS feed button.
